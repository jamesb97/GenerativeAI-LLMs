    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to introduce you to the process of pretraining large language models (LLMs) using the popular Hugging Face library. Hugging Face is a leading open-source platform for natural language processing that provides a wide range of pretrained models and tools for fine-tuning and deploying these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to load pre-trained models from Hugging Face and make inferences using the Pipeline module. Additionally, you will learn how to further train pre-trained LLMs on your own data (self-supervised fine-tuning). By the end of this lab, you will have a solid understanding of how to pretrain LLMs and store them to later fine-tune for your specific use cases. This will empower you to create powerful and customized natural language processing solutions.\n"

    "Pretraining is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to train large language models (LLMs) on a vast corpus of unlabeled text data. The goal is to capture the general patterns and semantic relationships present in natural language, allowing the model to develop a deep understanding of language structure and meaning.\n",

By leveraging the abundance of unlabeled text data, pretraining enables the model to learn fundamental language skills through self-supervised objectives, facilitating transfer learning.\n",

    "The pretraining objectives, such as masked language modeling (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP), play a crucial role in the success of transformer models.

    "Pre-training objectives are crucial components of the pre-training process for transformers. These objectives define the tasks that the model is trained on during the pre-training phase, allowing it to learn meaningful contextual representations of language. Three commonly used pre-training objectives are masked language modeling (MLM), next sentence prediction (NSP) and next Ttoken prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Masked Language Modeling (MLM):\n",
    "   Masked language modeling involves randomly masking some words in a sentence and training the model to predict the masked words based on the context provided by the surrounding words(i.e., words that appear either before or after the masked word). The objective is to enable the model to learn contextual understanding and fill in missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):\n",
    "   Next sentence prediction involves training the model to predict whether two sentences are consecutive in the original text or randomly chosen from the corpus. This objective helps the model learn sentence-level relationships and understand the coherence between sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next Token Prediction:\n",
    "    In this objective, the model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence of text. The model is presented with a sequence of text and must learn to predict the most likely next token based on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that different pre-trained models may use variations or combinations of these objectives, depending on the specific architecture and training setup.\n"
