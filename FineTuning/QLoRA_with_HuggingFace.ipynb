        "QLoRA is an extension of LoRA that leverages quantization. Quantization is the process of mapping continuous infinite values to a smaller set of discrete finite values. Effectively, the model's parameters are are stored in 2, 3, 4 or 8-bits as opposed to the usual 32-bits, lowering the number of bits needed to store information. Quantization offers two benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It reduced memory footprint. By using a finite set of discrete levels, the values can be represented with fewer bits, reducing the memory required to store them; and\n",
